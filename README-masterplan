## Master Plan
Skyfall Drop: Project Blueprint

TL;DR

A vibe-first, mobile-friendly free-fall arcade game. 
Instant play. No death. No pause. Just pure motion, juicy score progression, and a clean portal exit to your next game or someone else’s. 
Designed to feel good, look cool, and get shared.

Core Features
	•	Instant Start: You’re falling the moment it loads. No title screen fluff.
	•	Left/Right Dodge: Avoid birds, planes, and sky chaos. Touch + keyboard support.
	•	Score Builder: Score climbs the longer you survive. Hitting stuff reduces score.
	•	No Death: It’s about rhythm, not punishment. Collisions just slow you down.
	•	Portal Exit: Reach a score/time threshold and unlock a portal to exit.
	•	Mobile-First: Fully responsive canvas. Touch controls come first.
	•	VibeShot: Snapshot mode to flex your score with style. Pose, slow-mo, screenshot.

	3.	Score ticks up per second survived
	4.	Obstacles spawn – birds, planes, balloons etc.
	5.	Collisions reduce score slightly, player bounces
	6.	At a score/time milestone, portal appears
	7.	Player falls through the portal to end session
	8.	Optional: Trigger screenshot/slow-mo at any point
